    <h1>Description</h1>

    <p>These are my favorite cookies in the world! Every year my wife makes these cookies and I eat so many that I make myslef sick. I don't really care though because they are so good that it's totally worth it. I only allow myself to eat these cookies
      once a year because otherwise I would be sick all of the time.</p>

    <h1>Ingredients</h1>

    <ul>
      <h3>Cookies</h3>
      <li>2/3 cup granulated sugar</li>
      <li>2/3 cup packed brown sugar</li>
      <li>3/4 cup butter or margarine, softened</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon vanilla</li>
      <li>1/2 cup (from 15-oz can) pumpkin (not pumpkin pie mix)</li>
      <li>2 eggs</li>
      <li>2 1/4 cups Gold Medal™ all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <h3>Browned Butter Frosting</h3>
      <li>3 cups powdered sugar</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon vanilla</li>
      <li>3 to 4 tablespoons milk</li>
      <li>1/3 cup butter (do not use margarine or spread; it will burn)</li>
    </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <li>Heat oven to 375°F. In large bowl, beat granulated sugar, brown sugar, 3/4 cup butter and 1 teaspoon vanilla with electric mixer on medium speed, scraping bowl occasionally, until well blended. Beat in pumpkin and eggs until well mixed. On low speed, beat in flour, baking soda, cinnamon and salt.</li>
        <li>On ungreased cookie sheets, drop dough by heaping tablespoonfuls.</li>
        <li>Bake 10 to 12 minutes or until almost no indentation remains when touched in center. Immediately remove from cookie sheets to cooling rack. Cool completely, about 45 minutes.</li>
        <li>In medium bowl, place powdered sugar, 1 teaspoon vanilla and 3 tablespoons milk. In 1-quart saucepan, heat 1/3 cup butter over medium heat, stirring constantly, just until light brown.</li>
        <li>Pour browned butter over powdered sugar mixture. Beat on low speed about 1 minute or until smooth. Gradually add just enough of the remaining 1 tablespoon milk to make frosting creamy and spreadable. Generously frost cooled cookies.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>Lasagna is one of the oldest types of pasta. It’s an Italian classic that consists of layered noodles, cheese, sauce and meat. Identical to the recipe included in the 1995 edition of the Betty Crocker™ Cookbook, this lasagna continues to be a favorite
        and is often requested. Though the classic lasagna includes ricotta and Italian sausage, there are many creative twists on the tradition and different techniques to making it. The original lasagna recipe is said to have used béchamel sauce—a favorite
        ingredient still used today in classic lasagna recipes. Béchamel sauce is a simple white sauce made with just five ingredients. However you decide to make it, this family-favorite dish can be prepped ahead of time and refrigerated for up to 24
        hours or frozen for up to two months. Our step-by-step lasagna tutorial makes this classic recipe easy to master so you can add it to your regular dinner routine.</p>
